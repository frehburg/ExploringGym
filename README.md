# ExploringGym
In this repository I, Filip Rehburg will be exploring [gym by openAI](https://github.com/openai/gym) during and after my course Foundations of Reinforcement Learning at CityU Hong Kong.

## Modules

### Tutorial 1:[Getting Started With OpenAI Gym: The Basic Building Blocks](https://blog.paperspace.com/getting-started-with-openai-gym/)
The tutorial can be found under https://blog.paperspace.com/getting-started-with-openai-gym/

In this tutorial the 'MountainCar' environment will be used to introduce the user to the gym. During this, the basic
functions step, observation, reward, render, etc of the environment are explained. Afterwards, a short intro to wrappers
and vectorized environments is given.
